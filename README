NAME
      Graphics::ColorPicker : A perl module for WYSIWYG web 
      applications that allow selection of HEX color numbers

SYNOPSIS
      use Graphics::ColorPicker;
        or
      require  Graphics::ColorPicker;

      make_page($path_to_images);
      send_page(\$html_txt,$type);
      $time_string = http_date($time);
      $name = script_name;
      $html_text=frames($use_js);
      $html_text = msie_frame;
      $html_text=picker($darkimg,$liteimg,$size,$bsize,greyimg);
      $html_text=cp216_ds($clrdot,$border,$square)
      $javascript_text = jslib;
      $html=make_buttons(\%look_n_feel,$url,$active,\@buttons,$xtra);
      $html_text=pluck($color);
      $html_text=hex_update($hex_color);

DESCRIPTION
    This module generates a set of palettes to select a HEX or DECIMAL color
    number via a web browser. make_page() can be called by "javascript" from
    your web page and will set the HEX value in a variable in the calling
    page and scope.

      <script language=javascript1.1>
      var colorhex = 'none';
      function pop() {
        var colorwin = open("","picker",
        "width=630,height=440,status=no,directories=no," +
        "location=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,toolbar=no");
        if (colorwin.opener == null) newin.opener = self;
        colorwin.document.close();
        colorwin.focus();
        colorwin.location.href = './p_gen.cgi' +
      // the next line supplies the initial color
      // value to the picker and may be omitted
        '?hex = ' + document.forms.color.hex.value;
        return false;
      }

      See B<examples/demo.html> and B<scripts/p_gen.cgi>

    make_page($path_to_images);
          Generate Color Picker Pages

          This is the only routine that really needs to be called
          externally. You could roll your own from the subroutine
          calls described in the man page but it's really not necessary.

          i.e. Graphics::ColorPicker::make_page('./');

          will generate the picker pages as required
